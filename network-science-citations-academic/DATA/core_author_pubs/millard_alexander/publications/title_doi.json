The simplest model for this process involves coherent mixing of the scattering T-matrix elements associated with collisional transitions within the unmixed (a) over tilde and (X) over tilde states. From previous calculations in our group, we have determined cross sections and room-temperature rate constants for intersystem crossing of CH2 by collision with He. These are used in simulations of the time dependence of the energy flow, both within and between the (X) over tilde and (a) over tilde vibronic manifolds. Relaxation proceeds through three steps: (a) rapid equilibration of the two mixed-pair levels, (b) fast relaxation within the a state, and (c) slower relaxation among the levels of the (X) over tilde state. Collisional transfer between the fine-structure levels of the triplet ((X) over tilde) state is very slow.

A pulsed circularly polarized tunable dye laser prepared CN(A(2)Pi, v = 4) in two fully state-selected initial levels, j = 6.5 F(1)e and j = 10.5 F(2)f, with a known laboratory-frame orientation.

Collision-energy-dependent tensor cross sections for ranks K = 0 and 1 were computed for transitions from both initial levels to all final levels. These quantities were integrated over the thermal collision energy distribution to yield predictions of the experimentally observed state-to-state population transfer rate constants and MTEs. Excellent agreement between experiment and theory is observed for both measured quantities. Dramatic oscillations in the MTEs are observed, up to and including changes in the sign of the orientation, as a function of even/odd Delta j within a particular spin-orbit and e/f manifold. These oscillations, along with those also observed in the state-to-state rate constants, reflect the rotational parity of the final level. In general, parity-conserving collisions conserve rotational orientation, while parity-changing collisions result in large changes in the orientation. The QS calculations show that the dynamics of the collisions leading to these different outcomes are fundamentally different.

Ground-state CN(X-2 Sigma(+)) molecules were generated by pulsed 266-nm laser photolysis of ICN in a thermal (nominally 298 K) bath of the Ar collision partner at a range of pressures. The translationally thermalized CN(X) radicals were optically pumped to selected unique CN(A(2)Pi, v = 4, j = 2.5, 3.5, 6.5, 11.5, 13.5, and 18.5, F(1)e) levels on the A-X (4,0) band by a pulsed tunable dye laser. The prepared level was monitored in a collinear geometry by cw frequency-modulated (FM) spectroscopy in stimulated emission on the CN(A-X) (4,2) band. The FM lineshapes for co- and counter-rotating circular pump and probe polarizations were analyzed to extract the time dependence of the population and (to a good approximation) orientation (tensor rank K = 1 polarization). The corresponding parallel and perpendicular linear polarizations yielded population and alignment (K = 2). The combined population and polarization measurements at each Ar pressure were fitted to a 3-level kinetic model, the minimum complexity necessary to reproduce the qualitative features of the data. Rate constants were extracted for the total loss of population and of elastic depolarization of ranks K = 1 and 2. Elastic depolarization is concluded to be a relatively minor process in this system. Complementary full quantum scattering (QS) calculations were carried out on the best previous and a new set of ab initio potential energy surfaces for CN(A)-Ar. Collision-energy-dependent elastic tensor and depolarization cross sections for ranks K = 1 and 2 were computed for CN(A(2)Pi, v = 4, j = 1.5-10.5, F(1)e) rotational/fine-structure levels. In addition, integral cross sections for rotationally inelastic transitions out of these levels were computed and summed to yield total population transfer cross sections. These quantities were integrated over a thermal collision-energy distribution to yield the corresponding rate constants. A complete master-equation simulation using the QS results for the selected initial level j = 6.5 gave close, but not perfect, agreement with the near-exponential experimental population decays, and successfully reproduced the observed multimodal character of the polarization decays. On average, the QS population removal rate constants were consistently 10%-15% higher than those derived from the 3-level fit to the experimental data. The QS and experimental depolarization rate constants agree within the experimental uncertainties at low j, but the QS predictions decline more rapidly with j than the observations. In addition to providing a sensitive test of the achievable level of agreement between state-of-the art experiment and theory, these results highlight the importance of multiple collisions in contributing to phenomenological depolarization using any method sensitive to both polarized and unpolarized molecules in the observed level.

We calculate the rotational excitation rate coefficients of NO in collisions with He and check the validity of the LTE approach in interpreting observations of rotational lines of NO. Methods. State-to-state rate coefficients between the 360 lowest hyperfine levels of NO were calculated using the M-J randomizing limit method for temperatures from 10 K to 350 K. We performed calculations of the excitation of NO using the new rate coefficients using a large velocity gradient (LVG) radiative transfer code. Results. The critical densities of the lines are found to be at greater than or similar to 10(15) cm(-3). The low dipole moment of NO ensures that the line emission is optically thin up to column densities of similar to 10(15) cm(-2). Lines in the ground (Omega = 1/2) state are readily detectable in typical conditions (N(NO) = 10(13) cm(-2); T = 10-30 K), whereas lines in the excited Omega = 3/2 state are observed only in warm (T > 50 K) regions with higher column densities (N(NO) = 10(14) cm(-2)). Line ratios of NO may well be used to constrain the ambient temperature and/or density. Conclusions. The new rate coefficients will help significantly in interpreting NO emission lines observed with current and future telescopes, and enable this molecule to become a powerful astrophysical tool.", "image": "/page_data/researchers/millard_alexander/research_images/"}, {"title": "Interaction of NO(A (2)Sigma(+)) with rare gas atoms: Potential energy surfaces and spectroscopy", "doi": "10.1063/1.3040074", "abstract": "We present the results of an ab initio study of the interaction of electronically excited NO(A (2)Sigma(+)) with rare gas (Rg) atoms.

The present paper focuses on the calculation of rate coefficients among the first rotational levels of the SiS molecule in its ground vibrational state in collision with para-H-2 and compares these new data with recently published He ones to investigate the validity of using He rate coefficients to estimate H-2( j = 0) rate coefficients.

This involves four potential energy surfaces (PESs) and two, coordinate-dependent spin-orbit interaction terms, all of which were fitted to the results of ab initio calculations. Quantum scattering calculations, based on a time-independent method formulated in hyperspherical coordinates, were carried out to determine initial and final state-resolved reactive cross sections, for reaction of F in its ground (P-2(3/2)) and excited (P-2(1/2)) spin-orbit state with H-2 in j=0 and j=2(pH(2)) and j=1(oH(2)). The overall reactivity of the excited state of F, which can occur only through nonadiabatic transitions, is found to be small, at most 25% of the reactivity of the ground spin-orbit state, which is adiabatically allowed. In addition, when compared with results of earlier calculations, based on a single, electronically adiabatic, PES, our calculations show that even fine details of the dynamics of the F+H-2 reaction will be well described by calculations on a single PES. The contribution of the excited spin-orbit state can be seen most clearly in the formation of HF products in the v=3 vibrational manifold, which are nearly thermoneutral (or even slightly endoergic) in the reaction of ground-state F atoms.

We investigate three matrices: (a) a single B atom site substituted for a pH(2) molecule, (b) a similar site-substituted matrix with a nearest-neighbor vacancy, and (c) a B atom site substituted not in the bulk but near the pH(2) surface. It is found that small distortions of the lattice occur to permit an energetically favorable orientation of the 2p orbital, even in the absence of a vacancy.

A full kinetic simulation, based on the calculated cross sections, reproduces nearly quantitatively the experimental observations of both the temporal evolution and the pressure dependence of this h-doublet asymmetry. This asymmetry is a consequence of both an enhanced depletion of high N Pi(A') levels and the enhanced formation of Pi(A'') levels in the next lower (N-1) manifolds.

The gateway levels here are the Na2 A 1SIGMA(u)+ upsilon' = 26 approximately 3PI2u upsilon' = 28 J' = 16e,a-symmetry levels which are significantly mixed owing to an extremely small spin-orbit perturbation matrix element (the neighboring J' = 15 and 17e,s-symmetry levels are essentially free of mixing).

The qualitative observation of the gateway effect is that whenever an a-symmetry A 1SIMGA(u)+ upsilon' = 26 parent level is selected, b 3PI2u upsilon' = 28 daughter and granddaughter levels are observably populated, but when an s-symmetry A 1SIGMA(u)+ upsilon' = 26 parent is selected, essentially no population is detected in b 3PI2u upsilon' = 28 daughter and granddaughter levels (i.e., no perturbation, no interelectronic state transfer). The quantitative observation of the gateway effect is that when a J' = 12 (or 14)e,a parent is selected, the most efficiently populated rotational levels of the other electronic state are granddaughter levels centered about the J' = 16e,a gateway daughter level father than about the J' value of (or minimum energy gap relative to) the parent level.", "image": "/page_data/researchers/millard_alexander/research_images/"}, {"title": "THE STUDY OF FLUX REDISTRIBUTION DURING MOLECULAR PHOTODISSOCIATION - ADIABATIC AND DIABATIC ANALYSES AND APPLICATION TO THE DISSOCIATION OF CH3I", "doi": "10.1063/1.463838", "abstract": "This paper extends our new method for the study of the mechanism of molecular photodissociation.

This PES has been used in exact close-coupling (CC) quantum scattering calculations of cross sections for rotationally inelastic collisions. The dependence of the calculated cross sections on velocity, as well as on the initial and final states, is found to be in excellent agreement with the measurements of Smith, Scott, and Pritchard [J.

The calculated LAMBDA-doublet resolved cross sections have been compared with predictions based on formal analyses of the scattering equations both in the Hund's case (a) and (b) limits. For transitions involving low J levels, a strong propensity toward conservation of the e/f label was found, as expected in the case (a) limit. For higher J, the cross sections connecting related pairs of LAMBDA-doublet levels were found to be unequal, reflecting a quantum mechanical interference between the two potential energy surfaces arising from the interaction of a molecule in a LAMBDA > 0 state with a perturber. For transitions connected by even l terms in the expansion of the potentials, a simple analysis, based on the relative strengths of the l = 2 coupling matrix elements of the electrostatic potential, was found capable of explaining the relative ordering of the cross sections in most cases. A similar success for predicting transitions coupled by odd l terms in the potential was not found; this reflects the fact that the l = 3 terms are relatively small for the NH (A 3-PI)-He interaction. The calculated cross sections for large J also exhibit a propensity for conservation of the fine-structure label, as expected in the case (b) limit.

The more than 600 calculated interaction energies were then fit to a compact analytic form, which allow the determination of the interaction potential at any position above the surface. The strongest binding corresponds to a nearly flat orientation of the NO molecule, with approach of the N end slightly preferred, and with the single antibonding pi orbital of NO pointing toward the surface. In this geometry, the binding energy above, respectively, the atop, two-fold bridge, and three-fold center sites site is 2200, 1773, and 1574 cm-1.

The final state rotational distributions show evidence of at least four rotational rainbows, corresponding to scattering on (and interference between) the two PES which arise when the degeneracy of the NO molecule is lifted upon approach to the surface. A strong tendency is seen to populate the lower spin-orbit manifold at low to moderate final J, which disappears as J rises beyond 30.5 and the final states are better described in Hund's case (b). Simultaneously, there exists a propensity to populate those A-doublet levels in which the electronic-rotational wave function is antisymmetric (PI-A) with respect to reflection of the electronic coordinates in the plane of rotation of the scattered NO molecule. This feature is opposite to what has been seen experimentally. An approximate averaging over the lateral position of the NO molecule above the surface showed that although the rainbow oscillations are strongly sensitive to surface corrugation, the fine-structure propensities are not.
