<h2>Note to contributors</h2>
Please describe the approach to be taken in order to obtain the data we desire. Be as specific as possible,
and include workflow diagrams when needed.

*** NOTE: The set of initial articles will come from the theochemie.com researchers catalog

        * Once DOIs of interest are obtained
	        -- All data to be collected, cleaned, stored , etc, here within this directory
	        -- MUST DO A GOOD JOB OF RECORD KEEPING -> NAME FILES PURPOSEFULLY AND CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTION
	            -- WITHIN STORED DATA SETS (i.e. jsons) Select naming conventions and STRICKTLY ADHERE TO THEM (like table
	            headers, and dictionary keys)

<b>EXPLORE</b>: The impact and results from the high emphasis on extreme interdiscipinary bias. Is it as great as people swear by.
Is it in fact a good way to measure a researchers impact and potential. i.e. are those who frequently participate in ID project or even only ID projects
produce better and/or more meaningful/impactful work/results.
